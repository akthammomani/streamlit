    At **MENARA**, since the beginning, we made our mind to be unique in approaching this typical supervised machine learning problem, so here are the main reasons why you should trust our app: 

    * Built our dataset from scratch, utilizing multiple reliable sources (e.g., **[redfin](https://www.redfin.com/news/data-center/)**, **[realtor](https://www.realtor.com/research/data/)**, **[GreatSchools API](https://www.greatschools.org/)**,.. etc). For more details, check **[Data Wrangling](https://github.com/akthammomani/Capstone-Project-2-Menara-App-Predicting-House-Prices-CA/tree/main/Notebooks/Data_Wrangling)**.
    * Applied state of the art techniques in feature engineering: integrated Unsupervised Machine Learning - Clustering using K-Means and used Haversine Formula with Python to create crucial features in order to improve our final ML Model.
    * Selected Stacking Regressor as our final Model because it managed to make predictions that have better performance than any single model we trained. So, in Stacking, we used a meta-learning algorithm (Ridge) to learn how to best combine the predictions from Four ML Algorithms (Random Forest, GB, XGBoost and LightGBM).

    Good schools desire by **78%** of buyers makes **[GreatSchools](https://www.greatschools.org/)** the trusted source of schools rating for many parents and the partner of choice for so many leading real estate websites (e.g., redfin, zillow, realtor)

Last year, **GreatSchools** had more than 55 million unique visitors, including over half of American families with school-age children.
